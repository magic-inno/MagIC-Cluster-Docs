# Software

In the realm of software installation, whether it involves simple installation and
execution or compiling from source, the process can be challenging. However, we live in an
era dominated by data science, where numerous software installation solutions are
available across different platforms, including GNU/Linux, Windows, and macOS.

In Linux, the standard method for installing software is through system package managers.
For instance, Ubuntu uses apt, RHEL/Rocky/AlmaLinux/Fedora use dnf, Arch Linux uses
pacman, and openSUSE uses zypper. Even on Windows, you can use scoop, and on macOS, brew
is a popular choice.

However, these package managers are not without their limitations. They are primarily
designed for everyday users and may not always include the latest scientific software in
their repositories in a timely manner.

To address this gap, tools like conda, mamba, and pixi have emerged. These tools provide
more flexible and up-to-date solutions for installing scientific software.

Given these options, we must make an informed choice. Manually installing software is no
longer a viable or efficient approach.
