[GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) is an operating system that
combines the [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) kernel with
[GNU](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html) software, and many other open-source/free
software. It is a free and open-source operating system, meaning that its source code is
available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. GNU/Linux is widely used in various
environments, from personal computers to servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems.

## Key Components

- Linux Kernel: The core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources and
  provides basic system services. Developed by Linus Torvalds and a global community of
  developers.

- GNU Software: A collection of free software tools and utilities developed by the GNU
  Project. Includes essential components like the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the GNU C
  Library (glibc), and various command-line tools.

## Features of GNU/Linux

- Open Source: The source code is freely available, allowing users to study, modify, and
  distribute the software.

- Stability and Security: Known for its stability and robust security features, making it
  a popular choice for servers and critical systems.

- Flexibility: Highly customizable and can be tailored to specific needs and environments.

- Community Support: Backed by a large and active community of developers and users who
  contribute to its development and support.

- Distributions (Distros): GNU/Linux is available in various distributions, each with its
  own set of features, tools, and user interfaces. Popular distributions include Ubuntu,
  Fedora, Debian, CentOS, and Arch Linux. Here we used [Almalinux](https://almalinux.org),
  which is _An Open Source, community owned and governed, forever-free enterprise Linux
  distribution, focused on long-term stability, providing a robust production-grade
  platform. AlmaLinux OS is binary compatible with RHEL®._

## Uses of GNU/Linux

- Desktop Environments: Used as a desktop operating system with user-friendly interfaces
  like GNOME, KDE, and Xfce.

- Servers: Widely used in server environments for web hosting, database management, and
  other server applications.

- Embedded Systems: Used in embedded systems such as routers, smartphones (Android is
  based on the Linux kernel), and IoT devices.

- Supercomputing: The dominant operating system in supercomputing due to its performance
  and scalability. We are here.

- Development: A popular choice for software development due to its robust toolchain and
  support for various programming languages. We are here too when do bioinformatics tools
  development.

## Summary

GNU/Linux is a powerful, flexible, and secure operating system that combines the Linux
kernel with GNU software. It is widely used in various environments and is supported by a
large community of developers and users. Its open-source nature allows for extensive
customization and innovation, making it a versatile choice for both personal and
professional use.
