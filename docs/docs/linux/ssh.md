# ssh

[SSH (Secure Shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is a network security
protocol that uses encryption and authentication mechanisms to provide secure access and
file transfer services. Traditional remote login and file transfer methods, such as Telnet
and FTP, transmit data in plaintext, posing numerous security risks. As awareness of
network security has grown, these methods have become less acceptable. The SSH protocol
provides secure network services by encrypting and verifying network data, even in
insecure network environments. As a secure alternative to Telnet and other insecure remote
shell protocols, SSH is now widely used worldwide, with most devices supporting SSH
functionality. By default, SSH servers use port number 22.
