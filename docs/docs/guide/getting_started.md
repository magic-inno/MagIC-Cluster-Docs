# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- MagIC Server Account: Send an email to the Bioinformatics Core Team to request a server
  account. CC your team's Principal Investigator (PI) in the email.

- Computer with SSH Client: Ensure you have
  [OpenSSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH) installed on your computer. You can use
  terminal emulator like [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty),
  [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal),
  [iTerm2][https://iterm2.com/], or GUI application with many features such as
  [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) or [mobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).

```sh
ssh your-account-name@server-ip
```

Replace your-account-name with your actual account name and server-ip with the IP address
of the server.
