# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- MagIC Server Account: Send an email to the Bioinformatics Core Team to request a server
  account. CC your team's Principal Investigator (PI) in the email.

- Computer with SSH Client: Ensure you have OpenSSH installed on your computer. You can
  use either the SSH command-line interface (CLI) or an SSH graphical user interface (GUI)
  application like PuTTY or MobaXterm.

```sh
ssh your-account-name@server-ip
```

Replace your-account-name with your actual account name and server-ip with the IP address
of the server.
